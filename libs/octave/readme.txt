We occasionally use specific functions from Octave (in substitution to Matlab functions we do not have access to, i.e. from Matlab toolboxes).

Those functions are listed below.

The functions are modified to adapt to Matlab syntax requirements, e.g.
- endif
- endfor
- endfunction
- ! ismatrix(x) replaced by ~ismatrix(x) etc
- != replaced by ~=
